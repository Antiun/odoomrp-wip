Sale promotion gift
===================

This module allows you to create products and quantities of free gift in object
Pricelist Item Offers.

When a line is inserted into the sale order line, automatically free products 
are reflected in the new tab "Sale promotion gifts" of the sale order.

In this new tab when you click the button "Dump offer", defined as the product 
"Sale promotion gifts", they will be copied to the products defined as 
"Sale final gifts".

When you save the sale order, it will validate that the total of the 
category/quantity defined in "Sale final gifts", does not exceed to the 
total of the category/quantity defined in "Sale promotion gifts".
